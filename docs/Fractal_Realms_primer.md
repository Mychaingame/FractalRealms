# 🌌 Fractal Realms: Primer

## 🎯 Project Vision

Fractal Realms is a transmedia, collaborative worldbuilding project inspired by **immersive sims**, **4X strategy**, and **deep sci-fi multiverse lore**.

It explores the idea of **infinite variant realities** — diverging timelines, broken realms, and emergent world logic. Players, creators, and systems all contribute to a living Continuum shaped by choice, philosophy, and collapse.

## 🔍 Core Design Influences

- **Immersive Sims** (Prey, Deus Ex, Dishonored)  
  ↳ Player agency, layered environments, consequence-based storytelling

- **4X Strategy** (Endless Legend, Stellaris, Alpha Centauri)  
  ↳ Emergent faction interaction, ideology-driven expansion, tech-as-narrative

- **Sci-Fantasy Lore** (Numenera, Evangelion, Lexicon-style storytelling)  
  ↳ Cosmic recursion, posthumanity, metaphysical collapse, myth-as-simulation

---

## 🧱 Design Pillars

- **Worlds as Systems** – Each Realm operates under its own physical, narrative, or philosophical rules.
- **Factions as Ideologies** – No good or evil. Every faction embodies a belief about what the universe *should be*.
- **Collapse is Opportunity** – Shattered realms lead to new emergent behavior.
- **Player Actions Ripple** – Change one world, affect others.
- **Fractal Canon** – Lore may conflict. That’s intentional. This is a multiverse of imperfect reflections.

## 🧠 Key Themes

- Recursive Time & Meta-Reality  
- Philosophy vs Technology  
- Collapse as Metamorphosis  
- Emergence over Control  
- Identity Beyond the Self

## 🔄 Gameplay Concepts (Prototypes/Future Goals)

- Players may **inhabit a single Echoform** across multiple timelines
- Realm exploration blends strategy and story logic — some are dying, some are merging
- Factions try to **convert, fuse, or isolate** realms to advance their ideology
- Artifacts, codes, and decisions echo into other timelines
- Reality is unstable — players must decide when to **preserve** or **trigger** collapse

---

## 🛠️ Collaboration

Anyone can contribute:
- New realms, factions, or lore
- Mechanics, rulesets, or simulation tools
- Art, style guides, AI prompt frameworks
- Writing fragments that become canon through repetition or recursion

We build the Continuum — together.
