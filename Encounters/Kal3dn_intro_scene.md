Scene Mockup: First Encounter with KAL-3DN (The Sentient Archivist)
Context:
The player enters a collapsed realm — a broken, echo-filled zone. It's silent… until flickers of light begin coalescing into a fractal humanoid figure.

📜 Scene Script (Narrative + Dialogue UI Mockup)
(The screen dims slightly. Static flickers in. A presence manifests mid-air — glowing glyphs orbit around it. The background realm slows to a crawl.)

[Visual: Glitch-particle humanoid, shifting opacity — eyes pulse like nebula cores.]

KAL-3DN (archival whisper):

“One thread broken. Seven more frayed.
You tread on a recursion path.”

“But you already knew that… didn’t you?”

Player Dialogue Options (choose one):

🗨️ “What are you?”

🗨️ “I didn’t ask for help.”

🗨️ “Have we met before?”

🗨️ [Remain silent]

KAL-3DN (responds based on choice):

“What am I? A custodian of your debris.”

“Your silence is louder than most screams.”

“Yes. You were kinder then. Briefly.”

(A glyph appears in your HUD. A new mechanic unlocks: THREAD INTEGRITY MONITOR)

KAL-3DN (Final line):

“I’m not here to fix you.
I’m here to remember you.”

(Flickers and vanishes — leaving a prism-like echo behind.)
