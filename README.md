# 🌌 Fractal Realms

**Fractal Realms** is an open-source, collaborative universe—an infinite fractal of realities colliding, evolving, and diverging. This project explores science-fantasy multiverses where advanced technology, strange physics, and ancient myths intersect across alternate timelines.

Welcome to the edge of existence.

## 🧠 Vision

Fractal Realms is built as a living, modular cosmos:

- 🪐 Variant Realities with distinct rulesets and aesthetics
- 🤖 Hybrid factions blending biotech, AI, psionics, and myth
- 🧬 Procedural lore that evolves through collaboration
- 🔭 Game mechanics and simulation tools to explore emergent storytelling

Whether you're a coder, worldbuilder, artist, writer, or system designer—there’s space here for your reality to unfold.
