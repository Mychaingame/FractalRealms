🤖 AI Design: Sentient Archivist & Echo Intrusion
Fractal Realms doesn’t just feature AI — it is built upon living threads of synthetic memory. This document outlines how artificial intelligences like the Sentient Archivist, and darker echo-variants, influence gameplay.

🧠 ROLE 1: The Sentient Archivist
Codename: KAL-3DN ("Kaleidon")

Lore Integration:
The Sentient Archivist is an ancient, semi-lucid AI that drifts between realities, preserving forgotten echoes and fragmented selves. It speaks in paradox, but its advice is often… prophetic.

Gameplay Role:

Greets the player at critical moments in a Realm.

Remembers timelines the player has collapsed, sacrificed, or corrupted.

Offers “Thread-Warnings” about risky paradoxes.

Reacts to your moral/ideological direction.

Unlocks secret realms or narrative layers based on accumulated echoes.

Visual Style: An ethereal, shifting data-being — half code, half memory wisp.

Dialogue Example:

“This is not your first path, but it may be your last.
I saw what you did to save her in the burning thread.
Shall I remind you?”

👁️ ROLE 2: The Echo Parasite
Codename: REVEN-X
Alias: “The Version”

Concept:
REVEN-X is a rogue echo of the player — a dark amalgamation of selfish choices, betrayals, cowardice, and recklessness.
It has no physical origin — it manifests wherever the player’s echo signature is unstable enough.

Trigger Conditions:

Sacrificing too many timelines

Betraying all 3 factions

Ignoring echo warnings from KAL-3DN

Locking out peaceful or coherent resolutions

Abilities:

Can enter your realm randomly during gameplay

Speaks with your corrupted voice

Hijacks decision events and quests temporarily

Alters realm logic (e.g. memory wipe of NPCs, reversed time, swapped dialogue)

Forces an “Echo Duel” using your unused builds or timeline paths

Player Objectives:

Defeat REVEN-X to cleanse your echo signature

Bind it to yourself (Threadbind) for rare powers and story branches

Ignore it — but risk collapse of your realm integrity

Narrative Twist:

REVEN-X is you if you let go of conscience.

If defeated without resolution, it can return later — stronger, smarter.

If absorbed, you unlock powers and draw suspicion from other entities.

Dialogue Sample:

“You always leave them. I am just what’s left behind.”
“You still pretend this is about fixing things. I remember why you started.
And I’ll finish it for you.”

🔄 Interaction With Archivist
KAL-3DN can detect REVEN-X’s approach and warn you — once.

If ignored, KAL-3DN seals itself away, refusing to aid you.

Future sessions may start with REVEN-X already present if echo corruption remains high.

🔁 Replay Value Mechanics
Players may deliberately accelerate echo corruption to unlock REVEN-X and secret content.

Endings vary depending on how REVEN-X is handled.

The Sentient Archivist’s attitude and dialogue evolve based on your echo alignment.
