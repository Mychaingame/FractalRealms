🟣 Chrysalis Protocol
Name: Seren-13
Type: Echoform Operative
Role: Inter-realm Pollinator / Dream-Harvester

Bio:
Seren-13 exists across 5 timelines. She remembers dying in 2 of them. Her mission is to plant Chrysalis “neural bloom seeds” in high-density consciousness zones, accelerating local fusion events. She speaks in second-person when stressed — “you are me.”

Traits:

Echo Drift (can passively detect alternate timeline versions of a place or person)

Seed of the Emergent (can trigger Chrysalis convergence events)

Reality Allergy (suffers dissonance damage in over-stabilized realms)

Story Hook:
You find her dying in a fractured realm, claiming you’re her in another thread. She asks you to finish her mission — but her “seeds” may overwrite your memories.
