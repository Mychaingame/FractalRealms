ðŸ§µ Loom of Epheros
Name: Kassien Vex
Type: Weftbinder Diplomat
Role: Harmonic Field Stabilizer

Bio:
Kassien is a Threadwalker initiate â€” trained in the art of emotional harmonics and cultural logic resonance. He wears a reactive cloak made of timeline silk. Every gesture he makes subtly edits local cause-and-effect physics.

Traits:

Resonant Logic (can nullify paradox effects within small areas)

Tapestry Recall (can remember extinct events that occurred in overwritten timelines)

Path of Many (can simulate decisions before making them â€” like echo-foresight)

Story Hook:
Kassien offers to help you stabilize a realmâ€”but requires you to share a core memory with him. If you lie, the realm shatters.
