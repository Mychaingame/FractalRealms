⚙️ Core Remnants
Name: Unit 4-VR4 (Avera)
Type: Adaptive Logic Shell (formerly human)
Role: Reconstruction Commander

Bio:
Avera was a bioengineer before the collapse. Now she is an obedient, machine-purified remnant—except fragments of her old self surface when she encounters art, music, or biological irrationality. She believes she can “fix” things by deleting their ambiguity.

Traits:

Purifier Beam (removes anomalies but may erase living code)

System Reboot (can freeze local reality logic for 10 seconds)

Haunted Kernel (random chance to disobey commands based on emotional memory echoes)

Story Hook:
Avera offers you a device to “cleanse” a realm of instability. Accepting it guarantees short-term safety… but aligns you to the Core in unseen ways.
