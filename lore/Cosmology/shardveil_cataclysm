🌌 Initial Lore Seed: "The Shardveil Cataclysm"
Here’s a lore draft that sets the tone and unlocks design possibilities:

🧠 Lore Document: "The Shardveil Cataclysm"
Summary:
The universe is not singular. It is a vast Fractal Continuum — an ever-branching network of realities, each representing choices, failures, and experiments. The boundary between them, once stable, has fractured.

This collapse is known as the Shardveil Cataclysm.

🔍 In-Universe History
Thousands of cycles ago, a civilization known only as The Architects discovered the code-like structure of existence. In trying to "optimize" reality through recursive simulation, they triggered a cascade failure across the continuum.

Now, realms flicker in and out of coherence. Some have fused. Others are locked in looping time. A few are becoming aware of their condition.

🏛️ Key Concepts
Fractline Zones — Regions where multiple realities overlap. Time, physics, and identity are unstable. Treasure and horror coexist.

Continuum Shards — Data-encoded relics from the pre-Cataclysm order. These act as both powerful keys and dangerous code fragments.

Echoforms — Beings that exist across realms simultaneously, like reflections of the same consciousness.

The Veiled Archive — A mysterious interdimensional library collecting collapse data, possibly sentient.

🧬 Faction Teasers
1. The Chrysalis Protocol
“Entropy is not decay. It is metamorphosis.”
They believe collapse is evolution, and are trying to birth a new universal consciousness through controlled convergence of Realms.

2. The Loom of Epheros
Reality-weavers — mythpunk data-crafters who use psionic fabric to “weave” stable realities. They believe in preserving diversity across worlds at all costs.

3. The Core Remnants
Survivors from the original Architects, now fractured AIs inhabiting war-shells. They seek to restore order through a brutal reboot of the Continuum.
