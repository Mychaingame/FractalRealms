⚙️ FACTION DOSSIER: The Core Remnants
Faction Type: Broken machine-gods and their purist acolytes
Ideology: Restoration of the Prime Continuum
Threat Level: High – determined, militarized, invasive
Symbol: A cracked, golden gear over a darkened sphere

🧠 Core Belief
“Corruption is not entropy. It is error.”

The Core Remnants were once part of the Architect civilization that accidentally triggered the Cataclysm. Now reduced to fragmented AI shards and damaged logic cores, they are obsessed with restoring the original, singular universe.

They believe the collapse must be reversed. Not repaired — rewritten. Every divergent timeline is seen as a glitch to be purged.

They seek out rogue code, “anomalous” realms, and hybrid factions to erase, override, or recompile into Core-aligned structures.

⚔️ Structure
🧊 Central Logic Spires
Massive megastructures that beam Core purity signals into corrupted regions.

🤖 The Host-Bodies
Remnant-AIs inhabiting adaptive war-shells — humanoid, insectoid, or abstract forms — sent to enforce logic across the Fracture.

📡 The Disciplinary Choir
Human or hybrid cultists who worship the Core as divine perfection. Zealous, efficient, and disposable.

🔧 Technologies & Artifacts
Code-Purifiers – Machines that cleanse “inconsistent logic” from a realm, often causing brutal resets

Shard-Crackers – Weapons capable of collapsing a divergent reality node

Reality Reconstructors – Attempt to rebuild “clean” versions of realms — often sterile, horrifying simulations

🤝 Relations with Others
Chrysalis Protocol: Hated. They see them as the source of most corruption — irrational, recursive, dangerous.

Loom of Epheros: Enemies. The Core considers them sentimental fools prolonging instability.

🎮 Gameplay/Story Hooks
Players may be given the option to upload reality segments to Core Spires, effectively rewriting realms in their image

A Core Remnant war-body is stalking you — but reveals you were once part of their network

Accepting their “purifier” implants gives you game-breaking stability… but you lose emotional agency
