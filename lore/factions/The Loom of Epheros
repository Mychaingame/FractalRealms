🧵 FACTION DOSSIER: The Loom of Epheros
Faction Type: Reality-weaving cult-technocrats
Ideology: Multiplicity through harmony
Threat Level: Moderate to existential, depending on Realm stability
Symbol: An interlocking spiral tapestry overlaid with three moons

🧠 Core Belief
“No single truth is sacred. But all truths are worth preserving.”

The Loom of Epheros believe the Fractal Continuum was always meant to diverge. To them, the collapse is not a malfunction — but the result of too many ideological intrusions trying to force singularity.

Their mission is to stabilize the multiverse — not by restoring it to what it was, but by weaving divergent realities into harmonious resonance.

They are lore-weavers, quantum-tuners, and psychic diplomats, working to balance realms instead of merging or rebooting them.

🌐 Structure
🌀 The Council of Threads
A council of nine "Threadwalkers," each responsible for a domain of reality: Time, Memory, Physics, Emotion, Identity, Entropy, Logic, Culture, and Dream.

🪡 Field Agents: Weftbinders
Technomancers and diplomats trained to enter unstable realms and re-tune their narrative-resonance. They use psionic threading gear and bio-fabric totems.

🕊️ The Archive-Voiced
Lore-keepers who ingest and embody the memories of dead timelines. They can recall entire destroyed worlds… and sometimes speak in their voices.

🧰 Technologies & Artifacts
Weaver’s Looms – Massive psychic machines that stitch together shards of timelines into custom sub-realms

Tapestry Scrolls – Living documents that grow as knowledge is added; some can rewrite causality

Quantum Threadlines – Invisible links between realities that carry emotion, thought, or music across Realms

🤝 Relations with Others
Chrysalis Protocol: Tense rivals. They see Chrysalis as dangerously reckless — forcing convergence without regard for individuality.

Core Remnants: Adversaries. The Loom views the Core’s ideology as authoritarian and sterile — the antithesis of their harmony.

🎮 Gameplay/Story Hooks
The Loom tasks players with restoring equilibrium in a realm where one timeline is overtaking the others

Their agents offer non-violent solutions — but they may manipulate you, editing your memories to protect the larger weave

Players may gain a Threaded Echo — allowing limited narrative editing power (like redoing one past choice per world)
